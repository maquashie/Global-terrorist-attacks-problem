# Global-terrorist-attacks-problem
Global Terrorist Attacks Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2014. Some portion of the attacks have not been attributed to a particular terrorist group. In this project we develop a machine learning model that uses features such as attack type, weapons used, description of the attack, etc.to predict what group may have been responsible for a terrorist incident.
Data for the project is available at https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/
